## Not Life Coaching
### 90 Days. $1000

## 21-day Imperfection Challenges
### 21 Days. $250
21 days is apparently the magic number for change. And $250 is the magic number for us to feel like helping you.

Look, we get that it's not cheap. If you want cheap, go pay for a $25 course. You'll learn just as much that way. 

But maybe self help isn't about gaining more knowledge. Maybe it's not about being temporarily inspired by pretentious Instagram accounts. Maybe it's about doing hard fucking work. And maybe, given your history of dreaming big but falling short, you'd be massively better off with someone by your side. 

Someone to give you permission to do what you really want to do, even when it’s scary as fuck. Someone to love you when you don’t love yourself. And someone to bust your balls (lady balls and gender-nonconforming balls included) when you try to give up.

We'd like to be those someones.

If you have money, consider the value of Radically Marginal versus the value of upgrading your perfectly functional iPhone. And if you're broke as fuck, contact us. Money will never be a problem here.


## But since you probably don't trust us yet.

Jeremy wrote a satirical piece making fun of the self help industry. Turns out it's actually kinda helpful. And it's yours for free if you still have enough attention span to read things.

Sure, it's unlikely to help you in any way that reading some Chuck Palahniuk or Brené Brown wouldn't. But it might help you decide whether we're full of shit or not.
