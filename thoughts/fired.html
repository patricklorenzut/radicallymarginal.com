    <p>Hello all, thanks so much for having me!</p>

    <p>I’m a pretty silly human who wants to take another crack at this internet entrepreneur thing… but in a decidedly less serious way this time. I’m burnt out of the cookie cutter websites and the people taking themselves overly seriously. I wanna have some fun. And I want to lead with my heart and with my values.</p>
    
    <p>I have a background in all sorts of stuff, from Machine Learning to UI design, with varying degrees of success. In 2017 I sold a website for $75k.  The rest of the websites I’ve started have done less well ;)</p>
    
    <p>This morning I got fired from my day job (though I knew it was coming and I agreed to it) because, to oversimplify it, I was unwilling to write code to assist in drone strikes. I ain’t about that life.</p>
    
    <p>So now it’s back to the drawing board. I just whipped up <a href="http://lorenzut.com">lorenzut.com</a> today (many thanks to @stephen and WeerdBox for the assist), and now will probably do some mix of freelance work and app ideation until I figure out what the hell I want to do with my life… which may end up not involving tech at all.</p>
    
    <p>Look forwarding to meeting y’all!</p>
